            <p>I have a lot of different hobbies that vary from interest to
                interest
                but the ones that I have chosen to share show a variety of my
                skills
                and interests.</p>

                <p>Cooking is not only a really fun hobby but it's a great way
                    to
                    feed myself and my family. I enjoy the thrill of cooking and
                    making something new. I not only love the successes but the
                    "happy little accidents" from following a recipe that I have
                    never made before.</p>
                <p>I learned how to cook as a teenager, my mom taught me how to
                    make
                    pasta with a can of tomato paste, sauce, sausage, and
                    seasonings. I'm glad she did because the very first time I
                    tried
                    to cook potatoes, I sliced them and the put them into the
                    microwave. Needless to say, I did not eat those potatoes.
                    Here
                    is one of my favorite recipes that I like to share and make.
                    Since I am of Puerto Rican descent, cooking for me is a way
                    to
                    practice my culture.</p>

                    alt="A sega gamegear playing a game with a modified screen"></div>
                <p>Growing up in the late 90s, I was a big fan of having several
                    gameboys because they were always fun to play and I could
                    take
                    them anywhere on the go.</p>
                <p>One of the problems with them was the awful screens. You
                    would
                    have to be glued to a lamp or get an adapter to help
                    illuminate
                    the screens for you to play at night, which is when I got to
                    play as a kid.</p>
                <div><img src="images/about/sega-gamegear-2.jpg"
                        alt="The back of a sega gamegear with a modified screen"></div>
                <p>A few years ago, I was going through some of my old things in
                    my
                    parent's basement and I found my old gameboy. It bought back
                    so
                    many memories and I wanted to play with it again. Sadly it
                    did
                    not turn on and I decided to look into what I could do to
                    fix
                    it. This turned into a fixation and a hobby.</p>
                <section>
                    <div><img src="images/about/gameboy-before-1.jpg"
                            alt="a yellow gameboy color"></div>
                    <p>When doing research on my gameboy that didn't turn on, I
                        disovered that there was a whole world of different
                        repairs
                        and modifications that I could do to give my gameboy
                        color
                        new life. I decided to do the following:</p>
                    <div>
                        <ol>
                        <li>Get a new shell and buttons</li>
                        <li>Install a brand new IPS screen</li>
                        <li>Install a new speaker</li>
                        <li>Remove corossion from the motherboard.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                    <div><img src="images/about/gameboy-after-1.jpg"
                            alt="A translucent black gameboy color with orange buttons."></div>
                    <p>Here is the final result. I am very happy with what I've
                        done and the skills that I have learned.</p>

                <p>One of my favorite ways to spend time with friends is to play
                    different games. Out of all of the games that I play is
                    Magic the Gathering. I love playing magic for several reasons, including that it's a very social game and there are very many ways to play.</p>

                <p>One of the formats that I play is called Pauper. It's a way
                    of playing Magic on the cheap, only using commons to make up
                    your deck. Not only is it cheap, but since there aren't any huge
                    power imbalances, you can be more stragetic.</p>
                    <p>One of my favorite decks to play in the format is called Dimir Terror. The playstyle that I use is to counter my opponent, then use my used resources to my advantage. By stoppinmg my opponent with my soceries and instants, I can use those to play bigger creatures that I can use to win.</p>
