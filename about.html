    <p><img src="images/about/Ramon-torres-image.jpg" alt="#"></p>
    <p>My name is Ramon Torres. My pronouns are (He/Him/His) I am a
      photographer, videographer, and web content manager for the Academy of
      Natural Sciences of Drexel University. I've been working in museums for as
      long as I can remember. I started when I was 13 years old as a volunteer
      working with animals and now I do so much more.</p>
    <p>As a graduate from Community College of Philadelphia, I honed my skills
      of photography and videography. I took night classes at Moore, College of
      Art, getting my certification and learning about motion graphics and
      design. Now I am currently a student of Drexel University, working on
      completing my bachelor's degree.</p>
    <p>I love visual arts but my passion is photography and videography. I love
      creating wonderful images by using lighting to get different effects. In
      my day job, I don't get to do a lot of creative lighting work but when I
      do, it's a fun challenge.</p>
