            <h2>Plastic-free Philly</h2>
            <p><span>Summer 2023</span></p>
            <p>During my time as the web and social media assistant, I was
                tasked with a project that would help launch the marketing
                campaign, plastic free philly. The project was far from simple.
                It involved 10 different artists with all different art styles.
                A video was created for each art installation which were around
                philadelphia. The goal of this project was to get people to
                reduce their use of single use plastic consumption.</p>
            <p>My role in this was to work with our director of marketing to
                interview, film, and edit these artists to show their
                projects.</p>

                <div><img src="images/case-studies/pff-3.jpg" alt="An art installation made of plastic in the shape of several nets over window panels."></div>
                <div><img src="images/case-studies/pff-4.jpg" alt="An art installation made of plastic in the shape of a water fountain with trash surrounding it."></div>
            </div>
            <p>I worked with some really great artists with so many varying
                backgrounds. It was incredible to work with so many talented
                people and see what wonderful things they can do.</p>

            <h2>ANS Website Redesign</h2>
            <p><span>July 2025 - Current</span></p>
            <p>I am working on a website redesign for the Academy of Natural
                Sciences of Drexel University's new site. I am doing this in a
                software called Sitecore Gold. This is a content management
                system which allows me to quickly and efficiently add or remove
                components depending on what is needed for specific pages.</p>
            <p>My portion of the project is to manage and implement the different
                components to build a working site that helps accomplish the
                institution's mission.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Submitting bug tickets.</li>
                <li>Reading, understanding, and implementing components and
                    templates according to the documentation.</li>
                    <li>Following design guidelines to ensure site is implemented as intended.</li>
                <li>Selecting and uploading images, and writing alt text.</li>
                <li>Reviewing and fixing pages imported from Wordpress that have may have had errors during the migration.</li>
