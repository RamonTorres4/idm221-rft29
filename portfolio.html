        <h3>Members Night</h3>
        <p>Members' Night is a night that the Academy offers to it's members
          once
          a year. It's a fantastic event where the museum opens up the research
          areas and scientists can show off their incredible work and research
          to
          members.</p>
        <p>I've worked Members' Night over the years, and I have captured some
          really great images that really shows off the collection. Here are
          some
          of my favorites.</p>

        <h3>Halloween Animations</h3>
        <p>In 2019, I challenged myself to make 31 different animations for each
          day of October, leading up to Halloween. It was a tough experience to
          have one done for each day and to make something creative. Overall it
          was a fun and challenging experience. Here are some of my
          favorite.</p>
